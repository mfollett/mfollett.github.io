    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>***Update: Carl M&auml;sak (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/carlmasak">@carlmasak</a>) corrected some misunderstandings I had regarding the scoping of subroutines and the use of export.***</strong></p>


<p>When I first announced the Functional Perl series on the STL-PM <a href="http://tmtowtdi.com/">Bill Odom</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/stl-pm/browse_thread/thread/b93c52c02fc2ef2b">asked if I would be including Perl 6</a>. &nbsp;I declined at the time stating that there were sufficient difference between Perl 6 and Perl 5 to make the articles too busy. &nbsp;There aren't a huge amount of differences, but I didn't want to clutter a Perl 5 article with things like <em>method.assuming( x=&gt; 11)</em> or leave it out of a Perl 6 article. &nbsp;This article isn't an article about functional programming, but it is a talk about functions in Perl 6 so that I can later do functional articles.</p>


<h3>Named Functions</h3>


<p>Perl 6 sports an incredible amount of power and flexibility without losing a bit of the flexibility one can find in Perl 5. &nbsp;In fact, one could write a Perl 6 subroutine that looked like this:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/567852.js"></script></p>


<p>Or like this, which gives us type checking:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/567857.js"></script></p>


<p>But constraint checking can even move beyond basic type checking. &nbsp;Perl 6 can can provide further constraint checking with a <em>where</em> clause on a parameter:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/567871.js"></script></p>


<p>This version only allows us to give interest rates that will increase the future value. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Perl 6 also allows for functions to be able to declare through traits:</p>


<ul>
<li>if they are safe to automatically cache</li>
<li>the precedence (if it is for an operator)</li>
<li>tons of other stuff</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, explicitly stating all the implicit traits on a method can make it very verbose, like AppleScript verbose.</p>


<h3>Anonymous Functions</h3>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The Perl 5 way of creating anonymous functions is still valid in Perl6. &nbsp;However, you now use the method invocation operator ('.') instead of the '-&gt;' available in Perl 5. &nbsp;You can actually skip the method invocation operator since it can be implicit in this case. &nbsp;So, for example, you can make and use an anonymous subroutine like this:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571386.js"></script></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Perl 6 also provides for a lot of new approaches towards creating and using anonymous functions. &nbsp;In fact, according to <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S04.html">Synopsis 4</a>, every block is a closure. &nbsp;so, for example, you can now write an anonymous function simply by doing this:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571388.js"></script></p>


<p>If you wish to include a parameter list you can do so with a slightly modified version of that called the "pointy block":</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571390.js"></script></p>


<p>Additionally, If you read my post on <a href="http://mfollett.com/perl-6-whatever">Perl 6's Whatever</a> then you already know that you can use Whatever in a statement to close over that statement and create a function to evaluate it later.</p>


<h3>A Bump in the Road: Scope</h3>


<p>The move isn't completely roses for function happy developers though, there is one little hiccup you might encounter. &nbsp;This code, which uses a hash as a cache that's closed over in the subroutine will be a little different than the Perl 5 version:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571400.js"></script></p>


<p>That is because subroutines are now also scoped and are&nbsp;implicitly&nbsp;given the same scope as provided by 'my'. &nbsp;This is a simple matter though, we simply give the subroutine the 'our' scope. &nbsp;Here is the equivalent example in Perl 6:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571411.js"></script></p>


<p><span style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">A Tangent: Control Structures</span></p>


<p>This is a bit of a tangent, but I find it interesting. &nbsp;Do you remember when I said that any block is a closure? &nbsp;That counts for things you probably didn't consider, things like the blocks on if, while, and for statements. &nbsp;These are all now closures too. &nbsp;In fact, Perl 6 allows us to iterate over lists n-at-a-time because of this. &nbsp;The for loop will now pass us as many values as we provide as parameters in our block.&nbsp;Here is an example:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571425.js"></script></p>


<p>Of course, this example will complain when we reach 100, so we can do this:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571426.js"></script></p>


<p>The above example allows us to pass in 1-3 parameters, as many as are available. &nbsp;In this case though Mu is assigned to values that aren't passed in, which stringifies to "Mu()". &nbsp;We probably don't want that, so we'll just use defaults:</p>


<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/571429.js"></script></p>


<h3>Summary</h3>


<p>Perl 6 gives functions, named or otherwise, a wide variety of new syntactic features. &nbsp;It also really promotes the role of closures and anonymous functions, which is a welcome addition. &nbsp;Perl 6 is also bakes in new features, like memoization and currying.</p>


<p>Given all of that, I hope people understand why I'll be trying to keep Perl 5 and Perl 6 articles apart.</p>

    <link href="http://mfollett.github.io/week-2-closures/index.html"/>
    <updated>2010-09-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://mfollett.github.io/week-2-closures/week-2-closures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we will be covering <em>closures</em>. &nbsp;Closures are another basic concept of functional programming. &nbsp;They are based right on top of anonymous functions so if you haven't read <a href="http://mfollett.com/26878051">last week's article</a> it would behoove you to do so.</p>


<p>Closures are subroutines that "close over" variables thereby storing them in the scope of the subroutine to be accessed later. &nbsp;Values stored in variables that exist within the scope of a function are guaranteed to exist as long as the function does. &nbsp;This allows a developer to create subroutines that do many useful things, including provide state and encapsulate values.</p>


<p>In Perl a subroutine can access variables defined anywhere lexically above it, even once the scope that it is in is left. &nbsp;This allows us to access otherwise lost data.</p>


<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/556960.js?file=fpblog-week2a.pl"></script>
</p>


<p>Whereas if we change this example to simply:</p>


<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/556961.js?file=fpblog-week2b.pl"></script>
</p>


<p>This code will fail at compilation time because $value isn't defined in the outer scope.</p>


<p>This is not unique to named functions, anonymous functions provide the same functionality:</p>


<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/556962.js?file=fpblog-week2c.pl"></script>
</p>


<p>We can use closures to create new subroutines that have some state stored in them. &nbsp;For example, here is a subroutine that returns a subroutine that takes numbers to the power of the variable that was closed over.</p>


<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/556963.js?file=fpblog-week2d.pl"></script>
</p>


<p>It is important to note in the example above that each time power_of_generator is called the new anonymous subroutine returned has a new value to $power and cannot interfere with any other subroutines value of $power.</p>


<p>Another useful ability that closures have is that they can safely encapsulate data, more safely than many of the OOP approaches in Perl.</p>


<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/556964.js?file=fpblog-week2e.pl"></script>
</p>


<p>It is important to note in the example above that $name cannot be accessed outside of the scope of the outer curly brackets. &nbsp;As such, there is no way to set $name to a value that is not title cased. &nbsp;This is because the only way to set name is through set_name() which will not accept a value that isn't title cased.</p>


<p>The example above only provides the ability to store one name in a running program. &nbsp;If we wanted to safely store multiple names we could do so by wrapping the $name and accompanying subs into a larger sub.</p>


<p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/556965.js?file=fpblog-week2f.pl"></script>
</p>


<p>This concludes our discussion on closures. &nbsp;Next week we will move on to currying and a discussion on 'higher order' subroutines.</p>
